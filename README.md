# OOP_Java_Coursera_UCSDUnfoldingMaps
This is the project I completed in Coursera's object-oriented-java course organized by UC San Diego.
This project uses earthquake data and describes it by displaying it on a map, including signals such as whether the earthquake is small or large, whether the earthquake is on land or at sea, and whether the earthquake is large or small. Does the land affect the cities surrounding it?
